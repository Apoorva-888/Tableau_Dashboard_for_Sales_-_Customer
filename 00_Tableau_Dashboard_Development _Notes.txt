Tableau Dashboard Development – Theoretical Notes

STEP 1: Analyse Requirements
Objective: Understand business needs to create effective visualizations.

Collect Requirements
- Gather information from stakeholders or business users.
- Identify what business questions need to be answered.
- Determine KPIs, metrics, and critical data points.
- Document requirements clearly for reference to avoid misunderstandings later.

Choose the Right Charts
- Select chart types suitable for the data and analysis.
  Examples:
    * Bar charts – to compare data across categories.
    * Line charts – to show trends over time.
    * Pie charts – to show proportions of a whole.
    * Scatter plots – to show correlation between variables.
    * Heat maps – to show density or intensity of values.
- Ensure chart choice aligns with user understanding and is easy to interpret.

Draw Mockups
- Sketch dashboard layouts on paper or using software tools like PowerPoint, Figma, or Tableau itself.
- Identify where charts, KPIs, filters, and text boxes will be placed.
- Helps visualize final design before actual development.
- Consider spacing, hierarchy, and logical flow of information.

Choose Colors
- Select a color palette consistent with company branding or user preferences.
- Use colors to highlight important data points or differentiate categories.
- Avoid excessive or clashing colors.
- Use color meaningfully: e.g., red for negative trends, green for positive trends.

STEP 2: Build the Data Source
Objective: Prepare and clean data to ensure accurate visualizations.

Connect Data
- Import datasets from sources like Excel, SQL, CSV, or cloud databases.
- Ensure connectivity is stable, secure, and data is refreshed as needed.
- Validate that the correct tables and fields are being pulled.

Create Data Model
- Define relationships between tables using joins (inner, left, right) or blending where necessary.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity by checking primary and foreign keys.
- Avoid data duplication or mismatch between tables.
- Consider performance optimization when working with large datasets.

Rename Fields/Tables
- Use meaningful and user-friendly names for tables and fields.
- Avoid technical jargon or cryptic abbreviations that users may not understand.
- Keep naming consistent across dashboards.

Check Data Types
- Ensure numeric, string, date, and boolean fields are correctly defined.
- Incorrect data types can lead to errors in calculations or aggregations.
- Convert fields if necessary (e.g., string to date or number).

Understand Data
- Explore data using summary statistics: sum, average, min, max, distinct counts.
- Check for missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
- Document key insights about data quality and structure.

STEP 3: Building Charts
Objective: Create charts that accurately represent the data and answer business questions.

Create Calculated Fields
- Generate new metrics or KPIs from existing fields.
  Examples:
    * Profit Margin = Profit / Sales
    * YoY Growth = (This Year - Last Year) / Last Year
    * Cumulative Sales = Running Sum of Sales
- Use calculated fields to simplify repetitive analysis.

Build Charts
- Use Tableau drag-and-drop functionality to create visualizations.
- Choose appropriate dimensions and measures for each chart.
- Apply filters or segments to focus on relevant data.
- Combine multiple measures for comparative insights.

Format Charts
- Remove unnecessary lines and gridlines to make visuals cleaner.
- Clean up axis and headers: shorten long labels, add units, rotate labels if necessary.
- Coloring:
    * Apply consistent and meaningful colors for categories and trends.
    * Use diverging color palettes for positive/negative comparisons.
- Tooltip:
    * Provide additional context, explanations, or metrics when hovering over chart elements.
    * Tooltips improve user understanding and interactivity.

STEP 4: Building Dashboard
Objective: Combine charts into a cohesive dashboard for users.

Draw Mockups for Containers
- Plan the layout for containers (vertical, horizontal, or tiled).
- Decide placement of charts, filters, KPIs, and text boxes.
- Consider logical grouping of related information.

Build Container Structure
- Use containers to organize charts logically.
- Nested containers help with alignment, spacing, and responsive layout.
- Ensure charts and elements align properly.

Put All Charts Together
- Drag and drop charts into the containers according to the planned layout.
- Ensure dashboards are visually balanced and intuitive.
- Prioritize the placement of key KPIs and insights.

Format Dashboard
- Distribute objects evenly: align charts, text, and containers for consistency.
- Format colors, fonts, and chart sizes consistently.
- Fit Entire View: ensure the dashboard fits standard screen resolutions and is responsive.
- Add Legends: provide clarity for chart elements and color coding.
- Add Spaces (Inner/Outer Padding) to improve readability and avoid clutter.

Add Filters & Dynamic Elements
- Enable interactivity through filters, parameters, and actions.
- Examples:
    * Drop-down filters for categories or regions.
    * Date sliders for time-based analysis.
    * Highlight actions to emphasize data points.
- Dynamic dashboards allow users to explore data and drill down into details.

Add Icons/Images
- Include company logos, icons for KPIs, or images for better visualization.
- Use visual cues to draw attention to important metrics.
- Enhances user engagement and dashboard aesthetics.

Tips for Effective Tableau Dashboards
- Keep it simple and focused on the key metrics.
- Avoid cluttering with too many charts, colors, or unnecessary visuals.
- Use consistent color schemes for easier understanding.
- Test dashboard for responsiveness and performance across devices.
- Gather user feedback before final deployment and iterate based on suggestions.
- Ensure dashboards answer the original business questions and provide actionable insights.
